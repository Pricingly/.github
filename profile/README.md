# Pricingly

**Context (Why Does This Exist):**

Pricingly is a tool that allows simple and easy calculation of products. It's dynamic, visual, and helps you get the job done. I honestly made this project because I needed an easier way to do the math. âœ¨

The service is free, and I am always open to suggestions.ðŸ˜Š
